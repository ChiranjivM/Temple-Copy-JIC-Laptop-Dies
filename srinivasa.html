        <div>Sriman Narayana ( Lord Vishnu) himself manifested as Sri Venkateswara  at Tirumala Hills for protecting the people and establishing peace on earth.  According to Hindu scriptures, Sri Maha Vishnu, out of love towards his devotees, incarnated as Venkateswara for the upliftment of humanity and liberation from worldly bondage in this Kali Yuga. The Venkateswara swami temple in Tirumala is also called Kaliyuga Vaikuntam.
        
        As per Tirumala Tempe history, after marrying Princess Padmavati and questioned by Sri Mahalakshmi, Lord Venkateswara became a huge statue. Sri Mahalakhshmi embodied herself on to the left side of the chest of Lord Venkateswara, while Padmavathi Thaayaar did the same on to His right side. To bhakthas today, Lord Venkateswara provides Darshan with his consorts together.</div>

    <div><b>Lord Srinivasa</b></div>
        
    <div>Amongst all names of the Lord, Srinivasa is greatly celebrated by His devotees and the name Srinivasa means "One within whom Lakshmi (prosperity) lives".  Lord Srinivasa blessed His bhakthas with abundant Kshemam and bliss, as the inner meaning of this name would be "the source of light as a metaphor for life".
        
        Varaha Purana (1st Canto; Chap 61) praises Lord Sri Venkatesa: "There is no other God like Venkatesa (Sriman-Narayan) to seek refuge for protection and there is no other God equal to Lord Venkateshwara".</div>

        <div><b>Srinivasa Vaibhavam</b></div>
        
        <div>The Azhwars, the great saints of Sri Vaishnavam, have, through their hymns (Naalaayira Divya Prabandham), worshipped Sriman Narayana and his avatars by performing mangalasasanams in the 108 Divya Desams.  Tirumala, fondly referred as "Thiruvenkatam" finds an important place in many of the Divya Prabhanda Pasurams (202 Pasurams) rendered by the AzhwArs.
        
        Taking a sample from the Nector of Divya Prabhandhams, Poigai AzhwAr (first of the Mudhal AzhwArs) in "Mudhal Thiruvandhadhi" (Pasuram 99), praises the Lord as the one who manifests as " Antharyami" in all beings.</div>

        <div><b>Srinivasa Kataaksham</b></div>
        
        <div>According to the traditions of Sri Vaishnavism, Lord Srinivasa is the One and Only, who has the following Anandha Kalyana Gunams (Golden Traits of the Lord):</div>
        
        <div>·        He is the One who can give "Moksha" and offer happiness to all beings on the earth</div>
        
        <div>·        He comprehends everything and capable of doing whatever He chooses to do</div>
        
        <div>·        He destroys enemies of those who surrenders unto Him</div>
        
        <div>·        He is the "means" and "fruit" of all fruitful "goals' and "endeavours"</div>
        
        <div>·        He can be easily reached by means of "Prapatti"(Saranaagathi, i.e., absolute surrender)</div>
        
        <div>·        He is the Supreme Principle standing on top of "Thiruvenkatam" and took the incarnations of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna</div>
